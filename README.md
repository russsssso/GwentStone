# GwentStone
This is my implementation for the game of GwentStone

## Structure
The 'Game' class is where the game state is stored, and the majority of the logic is implemented.

The 'cards' package contains the implementations for the GwentStone cards: Minion, Hero and Environment cards.

The 'Board' class is where the game board is stored as a 4x5 matrix

The 'Player' class is where the player available decks, game deck, hand, mana and hero card are stored

'Utils' is a Singleton class where card names and useful constants are stored.
